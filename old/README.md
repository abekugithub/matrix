## Quick Start

### Local Development

1. **Clone or download the files** to your local directory:
   ```bash
   cd matrix-minimal
   ```

2. **Install the Matrix SDK**:
   ```bash
   npm install matrix-js-sdk
   ```

3. **Start a local server**:
   ```bash
   npx serve .
   ```
   
   Or using Python:
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   ```

4. **Open in browser**:
   ```
   http://localhost:8000
   ```

### Embedding in Your Application

To embed the Matrix client in your web application:

1. **Include the files in your project**:
   ```html
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/style.css">
   <script src="https://unpkg.com/matrix-js-sdk@32.5.0/lib/browser-matrix.min.js"></script>
   <script src="path/to/utils.js"></script>
   <script src="path/to/matrix.js"></script>
   <script src="path/to/rtc.js"></script>
   <script src="path/to/app.js"></script>
   ```

2. **Add the container HTML**:
   ```html
   <div id="matrix-client" class="matrix-client">
     <!-- The client will auto-initialize in this div -->
   </div>
   ```

3. **Auto-initialization**: The client automatically initializes when the DOM loads.
